# Tactics for term rewriting

The tactics in this file are useful for proving "rewrites", or substitutions,
where a subexpression of a term is replaced by another (related) subexpression.
They are heavily copied from Mathlib's `gcongr` and `grw` tactics and still use
parts of the supporting machinery, most notably the `gcongr` annotations for
congruence lemmas. However, the code has been dramatically simplified to only
support features needed by this project.

Solve a goal via a congruence argument: show that the goal's type follows from
the provided rewrite rule's type by "doing the same thing to both sides".

The goal's type must be of the form `tL ~ tR`, where `~` is a binary relation
and `tL`, `tR` are terms. The rewrite rule's type must similarly be of the form
`sL ≈ sR`, where `≈` is a binary relation (possibly the same as `~`) and `sL`,
`sR` are terms. The term `tL` must contain one or more occurrences of `sL` as a
subterm, and the same must hold for `tR` and `sR`. In addition, the only
difference between `tL` and `tR` is that `tL` contains `sL` in exactly the
places where `tR` contains `sR`; in other words, there is some function `f`
such that the goal's type has the form `f sL ~ f sR`.

This tactic applies theorems with `gcongr` annotations to the goal, recursively
reducing it to simpler relational expressions until the rewrite rule can solve
it directly. Thus, the tactic will fail if a relevant theorem is not annotated.
Some auxiliary goals may be generated from this process, but if they all have
exact matches in the surrounding proof context then the tactic will close them
automatically.

No attempt is made to unwind changes to the proof context on failure, and any
unsolved goals will "leak" into the top-level definition's context.

Core of the "predicate rewrite" tactic.

Given a goal metavariable of type `β`, and a function argument term of type `α`,
attempts to construct a function term of type `α → β` using the provided rewrite
rules and, if successful, assigns to the goal the result of calling the function
on the argument.

Callers should ensure that they're using the goal's metavariable context before
invoking this function.

/--
The "predicate rewrite" or "Prop rewrite" tactic.

Applies one or more transformations to the arguments of a relation or predicate
in `Prop`. For example, given `(α : Type) (a b c : α) (P : α → Prop)`, the
syntax `by prw [‹a ≃ b›, ‹b ≃ c›] ‹P a›` will produce a term of type `P c`.

This only works if appropriate congruence theorems have the `gcongr` attribute
attached. The example above would require a theorem like the following:

```
@[gcongr]
theorem P_subst {α : Type} {P : α → Prop} {x₁ x₂ : α} : x₁ ≃ x₂ → P x₁ → P x₂
```
