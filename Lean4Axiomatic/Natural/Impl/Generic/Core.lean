/--
Convert a `Nat` value to its equivalent `ℕ` value.

Lean's prelude defines `Nat` as its natural number type, so it's useful to have
a way to translate from it. In particular, numeric literals are represented
as `Nat` values, so if we want to have literals for `ℕ`, we need to convert.
See the `OfNat` instance below for more details.
